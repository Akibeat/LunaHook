This program no longer provides separate support, but I have not removed the workflow that built it. You can build this program yourself through the following simple steps (you don't need to know how to program, just follow my instructions)

1. Fork [LunaTranslator](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator/fork):

2. Open workflow **buildlunahook** in your forked program's Actions

3. Run this workflow, wait 3 minutes, github will automatically assist you build this program. The built program can download in the release of your own forked project.
